# Model Lifecycle: Governance & Versioning

## Versioning
- Use semantic versioning for all models (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Track model lineage in Azure ML
- Store model cards with each version

## Reproducibility
- Log all experiments with parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Use environment.yml for consistent environments

## Governance
- Review and approve models before deployment
- Monitor for drift and trigger retraining as needed
- Document all changes in model cards
