Oil production forecasting is the prediction of future oil output from wells using historical and engineering data.
Reservoir pressure is a key factor affecting oil production rates.
Choke size adjustments can optimize oil and gas flow.
Weather conditions may impact surface operations and production.
Water cut is the ratio of water produced compared to the total liquid output.
Gas rate monitoring helps detect reservoir changes and optimize recovery.
Artificial lift methods are used to enhance oil production when natural pressure declines.
Routine well testing provides data for production optimization and forecasting.
Enhanced oil recovery techniques can increase the amount of oil extracted from a reservoir.
Digital oilfield technologies enable real-time monitoring and data-driven decision making.
